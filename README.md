# Keycloak AI SIG

AI is everywhere these days, and Keycloak can both be a solution to AI security, as well as leveraging AI.

In broad terms we can divide this into:

* Securing AI applications (applications, cli, MCP, RAG, etc.)
* Hardening Keycloak deployments (detecting and blocking malicious activity)
* Help and guidance on configuring and maintaining Keycloak deployments and realms
* Maintaining Keycloak with the help of AI (vibe coding, reviewing issues, etc.)

There are already loads of discussions, prototypes, presentations, and examples leveraging Keycloak in this context, but we are lacking a general vision and plan forward for the project as a whole.

We are looking at setting up a new SIG around Keycloak and AI. At the moment this is just a proposal and the SIG has not be setup at this point, if you are interested in joining please add a comment to https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-ai-sig/discussions/1.
